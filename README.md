# Spotify Subset

The 'Subset Spotify' includes file names from the Spotify Dataset (Tanaka et al. (2022)) for classifying language variations in Brazilian Portuguese. The selection of file names resulted from applying a filter to the original dataset metadata, focusing on idiomatic expressions and names or acronyms of locations.
